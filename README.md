> Based on iOS platform ( 闫涵|刘原铭 共同创建)

## 1 Background
* When we were young, we had dreams. We wanted to travel in the space using our own foot. In order to achieve that dream in the virtual world, we want to create a game called “Air Tunnel Walk”. People will encounter the monster or obstacle. People can play it on the bus, subway in order to kill their time using their iPhone.

## 2 Design Goal
1. The initial status of game role is walking forward along the bottom edge. 
2. Players control the walking track of game role through clicking on the mobile screen.
3. There are many kind of monster and the other obstacle, those things will show up according to the random probability. The game role will die if they hit the monster & obstacle.
4. The gold coin will show up through the walking process of the game role. If they hit the coin, then will get the bonus.
5. The difficult of the game will increase through the time goes by.

## 3 Major Features
1. Player can control the "Air walker" clicking their iPhone screen.
2. Player can earn virtual money by hitting the bonus things.
3. When a player hits a monster or encounters an obstacle, he will die. 
4. Game will not end until the player dead. It should be infinite.
5. Player will lose gravity because they were in the space. So that they should control the physics engine to keep their balance (or something new playing way that players explored).
